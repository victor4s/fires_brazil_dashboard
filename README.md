In this small work I put into practice some of the teachings I had in the Data Visualization with Python from Coursera course. Which I honed my data visualization skills with the Plotly, Dash and Folium libraries.
The dashboard in question was developed with an interface using Dash and interactive charts from the Plotly library.
